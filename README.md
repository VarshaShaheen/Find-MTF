## About

The optical transfer function (OTF) of an optical system specifies 
how different spatial frequencies are handled by the system. 
It is used by optical engineers to describe how the optics project 
light from the object or scene onto detector or simply the next item 
in the optical transmission chain. 
A variant, the modulation transfer function (MTF), neglects phase effects, 
but is equivalent to the OTF in many situations.

In normal operation MTF is fourier transform of Point Spread Function (PSF).
But for slanted edge targeted MTF calculations we use Line Spread Function (LSF)
instead of PSF. This is because we assume LSF as cross-section of PSF along slant.
LSF can be optained using detivative of Edge Spread Function (ESF).

Since LSF is crossection of PSF along slant edge, a better aproach will be 
calculating MTF for both horizontally and vertically tilted images.

For line scan operations it is better to calculate along track and 
across track MTF's.

Also for non symetrical pixel pitch/sizes sensors it will also be convinient
to calculate horizontal and vertical slants.

Note that, the prefered slant tilt is between 2 degree and 10 degree.
